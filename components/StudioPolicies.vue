                <p class="mt-6">
                    By scheduling an appointment, you are granting authorization to The Glowing Artistry’s lash artists
                    to perform the semi-permanent eyelash extensions procedure. This entails affixing individual
                    synthetic eyelashes to your natural lashes. It is imperative and your responsibility to maintain
                    stillness throughout the application process, to keep your eyes closed unless instructed otherwise.
                    While uncommon, potential risks associated with this cosmetic procedure include transient eye
                    redness, irritation, and allergic reactions to the under-eye gel pads, adhesive or any other
                    products used. Should any discomfort arise during the procedure, please promptly notify the lash
                    artist for appropriate action, which may involve cessation of the session.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-6">
                    We do not provide guarantees, warranties, promises, commitments or other statements regarding the
                    outcome of the service, and you acknowledge that no specific assurances have been made in this
                    regard. At the start of every appointment all conditions and circumstances regarding your health,
                    medication and health history must be disclosed, including any past reactions to products, on the
                    “Client Registration and History Form”.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-6">
                    By accepting these terms, you release The Glowing Artistry’s eyelash extension lash artist from any
                    liability for undisclosed preexisting conditions or any subsequent changes to those conditions. You
                    assume full responsibility for any complications arising during or after the procedure.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-6">
                    Photos may be taken prior to, during, or after the application for marketing and training purposes.
                    Kindly inform your lash artist if you prefer to abstain from having your photos utilised or if you
                    wish to limit the visibility of your eyes in the photos. We will make every effort to ensure your
                    images are not used if you would prefer.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-light-olive">Booking Terms:</h2>
                <p class="mt-6">
                    To confirm your appointment, a non-refundable $50 deposit is required at the time of booking.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-light-olive">Cancellation Policy:</h2>
                <p class="mt-6">
                    Cancellations or rescheduling must be made at least 48 hours in advance to avoid forfeiture of the
                    deposit. This can be done by email or by text. Should you cancel or reschedule with less than 48
                    hours notice, your deposit will not be refunded with no exception and the full payment of the
                    appointment may be charged.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-6">
                    No-shows or missed appointments will incur full payment charges. Clients who provide less than 48
                    hours notice are welcome to send another client in their place.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-6">
                    We understand that there may be unforeseen circumstances and if an appointment needs to be cancelled
                    with more than 48hrs notice, we may transfer the deposit to another appointment as a ‘reschedule’.
                    All deposits are NON-REFUNDABLE and management reserves the right to choose to issue a refund under
                    some circumstances and if a refund is processed, processing fee of $5 will be charged.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-light-olive">Late Arrivals:</h2>
                <p class="mt-6">
                    Please arrive punctually for your appointment, as tardiness may result in the requirement for us to
                    shorten the length of your appointment duration, with full charges applied, to avoid causing an
                    inconvenience to the next client. We regret to inform that late arrivals may not receive an
                    extension of time to the scheduled appointments.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-6">
                    Should you be more than 15 minutes late without prior communication, your appointment may be
                    cancelled, and the full charge for the appointment will be processed.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-light-olive">Allergic Reaction:</h2>
                <p class="mt-6">
                    Your well-being and safety are our foremost concerns. If you have previously experienced allergic
                    reactions from a previous studio, please schedule a consultation prior to booking an appointment to
                    discuss your experience and address any concerns. Our cancellation policy applies where
                    sensitivities are not brought up prior to you booking where the eyelash extensions treatment
                    appointment cannot proceed.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-6">
                    If during our consultation, we may discover that you may not be a candidate for eyelash extensions,
                    and if you choose not proceed with the appointment due to a risk involved, a fee of 50% of the
                    appointment will be charged. So again, please make sure you book in a Patch Test consultation if you
                    are unsure about getting eyelash extensions and would like to discuss the risks involved.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-light-olive">Refill Appointment Terms:</h2>
                <p class="mt-6">
                    We do not conduct refills for sets obtained from other establishments. Refill appointments are
                    exclusively available for clients who have previously received services at The Glowing Artistry.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-6">
                    When booking in your refill, please ensure you have at least 30% of your extensions left and also
                    schedule your refill within 4 weeks of your last appointment.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-6">
                    The number of lash extensions administered during refill appointments is contingent upon the
                    allocated appointment duration and the condition of your lashes. If we have to clean your lashes
                    from makeup residue and build up, this will affect the time and number of lash extensions applied.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-6">
                    To prevent any cause of inconvenience to other clients, it is essential to arrive without makeup and
                    with clean lashes, and ensure that you have booked in the correct amount of time for your refills.
